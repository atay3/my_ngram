# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task
Write a program that counts the number of occurances per character. The program should take one or multiple strings as arguments and display one character per line with the number of times it appears.

The order should be alphanumerical.

## Description
An array is used to store the number of occurences per character from the strings passed in as arguments. An unsigned char is used as the array's indices. Using this array, the characters and their occurances are printed in alphanumerical order if a character has a frequency of 1 or more.

## Installation
You can clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/atay3/my_ngram.git
```

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the directory containing the Makefile and execute the following command in your terminal to compile the project:
```
make
```

## Usage
To run the program, use the following command in your terminal:
```
./my_ngram "argument1"
```
Replace "argument1" with the desired input for your program. Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to execute the make command and run the program.
